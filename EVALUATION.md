## Tool Evaluation
We evaluated IFSE on 79 programs in CoreUtils, a widely used open-source core tool program collection in Unix-like operating system, to demonstrate IFSE's effectiveness when facing real-world applications. 

We compared IFSE with its baseline KLEE with `4` hours timeout and `8` seconds fuzz solver timeout.

Due to limited space in the paper, we only presented the overall situation of the experiment and list some supplementary details including:

- `Line Coverage`: Compared to KLEE, how is the situation of IFSE covering the number of lines of program?

- `Branch Coverage`ï¼šCompared to KLEE, how is the situation of IFSE covering the branches of program?

- `Optimization strategies`: What is the impact of the main optimizations adopted by IFSE on its performance?



### Line Coverage

Line Coverage Comparison of IFSE and KLEE:

- Average Line Coverage:

  - IFSE: **54.8%**

  - KLEE: **42.7%**

  - Relative Improvement: Ranging from **0.7%** (readlink) to **357.9%** (cut) across **63** programs

- the **Union** represents the coverage achieved by all test cases generated by IFSE and KLEE, indicating that **the majority of new program paths are indeed explored by IFSE rather than KLEE**.

### Branch Coverage

As for branch coverage, IFSE achieves a higher average line coverage for most of the programs (51 programs) ranging from relative TODO\% to TODO\% over KLEE and achieves an average line coverage of 64.2\% (while KLEE averaged 57.7\%), which demonstrates the branch exploration ability of IFSE, the details are as follows:

Branch Coverage Comparison of IFSE and KLEE:

- Average Branch Coverage:

  - IFSE: **64.2%**

  - KLEE: **57.2%**
  
  - Relative Improvement: Ranging from **0.5%** (who) to **325.5%** (cut) across **51** programs

### Optimization Strategies

As an open-source tool, **IFSE** employs various optimization strategies to enhance its usability. Among these strategies, the **splitter** and **predictor** hold relatively significant importance:

- **Splitter**: This component focuses on identifying constraints that are likely to be unsolvable, allowing it to immediately return results and thereby reduce unnecessary solving.
- **Predictor**: This component aims to remove parts of the constraints that do not affect the solving result, thus reducing the search space for solving.

#### Ablation Experiments

To study their impact on the performance of IFSE, we conducted ablation experiments with four configurations:

1. **IFSE with neither**
2. **IFSE with predictor**
3. **IFSE with splitter**
4. **IFSE with both**

#### Line Coverage

In evaluating 79 CoreUtils programs, the results show:

- The **splitter** improves the average branch coverage by **37.3%**.
- The **predictor** improves the average branch coverage by **2.9%**.
- Using both together enhances the coverage by **43.8%**, indicating that the two optimizations are complementary. The **predictor** may assess the satisfiability of large constraints **more accurately** when these constraints are scaled down first by the **splitter**.

The following figure shows the branch coverage of 12 programs in CoreUtils with the largest coverage improvement under different configurations. Other programs show a similar trend.

#### Branch Coverage

In evaluating 79 CoreUtils programs, the results show:

- The **splitter** improves the average branch coverage by **21.7%**.
- The **predictor** improves the average branch coverage by **2.2%**.
- Using both together enhances the coverage by **25.6%**.

The following figure shows the branch coverage of 12 programs in CoreUtils with the largest coverage improvement under different configurations. Other programs show a similar trend.
